  @brief our entropy estimator function
  This uses the zlib compressor on streaming data on the smallest possible
  block size to give us an estimator for entropy
  Larger block sizes would be better, but the typical 32k would take too long
  to get results.
  @param trng The trng instance to use
  @param data the input data buffer
  @param n the number of input bytes
  @return 1 if more data is needed to get an estimate,
  this only happens at startup when we need at least one block of input before
  we can produce an estimate of the available entropy. 
  0 otherwise.
  @note 
  - We keep a running average of bytes in/bytes out to avoid overflow problems.
  - The idea of using a compression function as an estimator is good but
  it takes a lot of data before good estimates are available, since we mix
  this with TOD down to nS resolution the first set of data is known good
  - Bytes out always trail the bytes in by a significant margin. 
  Rather than wait until we have enough data to flush the output automatically, 
  we flush/reset it every n bytes so that we can measure the compression ratio
  reliably. 
  - Life is full of compromises - but this will reliably detect a TRNG failure.
  \FIPS This is the FIPS 140-3 TRNG entropy estimator
