/* Gathering entropy from noise in software 
   In principle, we sample a counter when the processor has been dragged away to do other things and that should be random as seen from userspace.
   How do we determine that ?
   IF the processor were not disturbed we'd simply get repeating values for the difference between 
   samples counter values. 
   This software generates data covering that scenario. There are occasional drops in entropy at certain sampling rates but essentially this would mostly
   pass all the NIST tests. (Not a good thing (TM))

   The next scenario covered is sampling from a real PC event counter.


   This is test case code to cover most of the good AND bad scenarios because there are risks in sampling from a counter.

   So we guarantee we are only sampling the counter after there's been a burst of noise by
   histogram sorting the timing delta's and storing the first few actual timer values in each group (TE_MAXB)
   Throw away the sets with the largest buckets (>= TE_MAXB in the that bucket) and what we have left is sets of counter values from after a burst of noise.
   - The high pass filter doesn't guarantee we have only one bucket without noise as we could hop between values. 
   - Note also that we don't assume any particular burst of reads will contain noise, we simply keep trying until we have enough samples to assemble a byte. (See dynamic tuning)
   We mix the low bytes of 8 of these samples to produce a single byte of output. (rotated xor)

   The reason for mixing is that we can't guarantee that the LSBit of the timer was advancing by 1 count and we don't know the counter stride but we do know we
   sampled with noise injected and any entropy from that gets spread across the sampled data.
   By mixing we remove the need to know the stride. This being easier and faster than doing that by other means.

   There's a dynamic tuning phase here to try and keep us sampling in the region where we will pick up noise
   it's fairly crude but it doesn't have to be wonderfully accurate to work. That's needed because processor
   clocks aren't constant.

   We also pre-calculate which is the lowest moving bit and down shift so that's the LSBit, 
   having stuck or sometimes special purpose bits at the low end of these counters is common.
