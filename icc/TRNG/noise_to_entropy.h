  PROC_MEM and PROC_DEBIAS are attempts to improve the distribution characteristics in problem
  cases (mainly Z). Code, including a default dummy no-op variant can be found in ext_filter.c
  They are defined at BUILD time, i.e. in the Makefile or test code as we need to do A->B 
  comparisons on the captured data. Which means that ideally we aim to build multiple variants
  so we can find which is best. 


  Note: PROC_DEBIAS appears to be an unconditional win and well worth the performance hit
  and is enabled in the ICC Makefile when compiling timer_fips.c

  @brief
  - This routine implements common processing for noise
  sources ICC uses.
  - Checks the entropy
  - Applies the NIST Adapative Prediction and Repeat Count
  tests
  - turns a stream of bytes into a buffer full of bytes
  with the entopy guarantee met
  - DOES NOT perform further conditioning
  @param E pointer to data for the entropy source
  @param data buffer for returned value
  @param len length of returned value
  @return 0 on sucess, 1 on fail (Health test failed repeatedly)
  @note 
  - Our entropy guarantee at this point is 0.5bits/bit and
  that's hardwired into the tables in the AP and RC tests.
  - There's a final sanity check on output data stream later, a compression
  test, which doesn't appear in the NIST tests
